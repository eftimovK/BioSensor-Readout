Description:
-----------
    This example demonstrates how to use the I2S controller driver to play audio
    samples on a audio codec. In this example the I2S controller interfaces with
    the SSM2518 audio codec. The example configures the audio codec using the
    I2C interface.
    
    The example writes audio data to the codec using various operating modes 
    supported by the I2S driver. The example plays the sine wave audio sample
    files. Two sine wave sample files are used by the example, a 16 bit 8khz audio
    file and a 24 bit 8khz sample file. The files are generated by sampling 
    800 Hz sine wave.
    
    The example can be configured to play either 16 bit or 24 bit audio samples.
    The BITS_PER_SAMPLE macro should be defined to 16 or 24 for playing 16 bit
    or 24 bit audio samples.
    
    The NUM_CHANNELS macro can be used to play in mono or stero mode. Set the
    NUM_CHANNELS to 1 for mono mode and 2 for stereo mode.
        
Running the test:
----------------

    1. Build, download the test to an ADuCM350 target board.
    2. Follow the Hadware setup section to connect the Audio board and speaker.
    3. Run the program.
    4. Hear the audio ouput through the speaker.
    5. Once the example has finished, it sends a result message string to the UART/
       Terminal I/Ooutput; "PASS" for success and "FAIL" (plus failure message) for 
       failures.

Hardware Setup:
---------------
This example uses the SSM2518 Audio Codec to play a prerecorded sine wave over the I2S bus
on the "ADuCM350 Audio Board" daughter board (Rev-A).

	* Verify jumper link positions on the Audio Board:
        LK1=B
        LK2=B
        LK3=B
        LK4=B

	* Connect a speaker across the output terminals (J2) of the Audio Board:  L+ and L-.

	* Plug the Audio board into the "Digital Header 2" (J1) connector on the main "EVAL-ADUCM350EBZ"
	  evaluation board (Rev.0/Rev.B).


OUTPUT
Test output is printed to STDIO, which is reported to the debugger console via the
semi-hosting facility (see the "Capturing STDIO from Examples" section of the
"ADuCM350BBCZ Software Users Guide").  Note: semi-hosting is enabled by default in
most examples.  Typically, each example prints "PASS!" or "FAIL: <filename,
linenumber, message>" messages, depending on success or failure of the example run.
Some tests provide additional performance data or message reports during the test
run.  Performance messages are formatted as "PERF: <message>".
