This is a test for the CRC controller. The CRC of a contiguous  address
range is calculated using the hardware CRC controller and the CRC DMA channel.
The CRC result is compared to a value calculated through a software CRC
implementation.

OUTPUT
Test output is printed to STDIO, which is reported to the debugger console via the
semi-hosting facility (see the "Capturing STDIO from Examples" section of the
"ADuCM350BBCZ Software Users Guide").  Note: semi-hosting is enabled by default in
most examples.  Typically, each example prints "PASS!" or "FAIL: <filename,
linenumber, message>" messages, depending on success or failure of the example run.
Some tests provide additional performance data or message reports during the test
run.  Performance messages are formatted as "PERF: <message>".
