dma limitation ?? up to 1.7kHz only
--> seemingly the sprintf() causes the limitation
    if commented out, all dma cycles get completed, but dmaRxRemaining is max ~64000 (16bit); why though?

on the other hand, if we allow a wait command in the sequencer after the measurement, all dma cycles can be
successfully transfered; but where do the values come from? are these the values that the ADC outputs
during the waiting? (and thus represent only noise)
--> these values might still be from the first values (160kSPS from ADC)


check where system clock is set
--> ADC clock not individually controllable, see the divider HCLKDIVCNT

debug where a single transfer takes place

does the wrong crc code make a difference?
