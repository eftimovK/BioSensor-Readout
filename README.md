# Project Information

## Brief Description
As part of the [SensUs competition](https://www.sensus.org/), the goal is to develop a readout system for the biosensor of team AixSense, RWTH Aachen. 

This repository contains therefore all necessary resources and code required for the readout system, using the [ADuCM350 device](https://www.analog.com/en/products/aducm350.html).
