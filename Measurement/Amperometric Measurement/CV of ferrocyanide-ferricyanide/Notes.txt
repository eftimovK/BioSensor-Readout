*Cyclic voltammetry of ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox using Palmsense's Metron dropsense 250AT*

-voltage sweep in range [-0.4, 0.8] V
-cycle duration is 3.2seconds

-plot looks mirrored regarding the y-axis, since higher current corresponds to lower ADC code

-the suffix 'handy' means a mobile phone was used in close proximity of the chip/electrodes in order to keep the chip stay straight (don't ask)
